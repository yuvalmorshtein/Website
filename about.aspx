     <p style="text-decoration:none; text-align:center"> My name is Yuval morshtein. I study in "Rabin" high school in Kfar Saba. I chose this topic, because that soccer is one of my favorite hobbies,
                and "The Champions League" is the biggest soccer tournament.
                In addition, I was really interested on how the tournament works.<br /><br />

                In the designing of the website, I have learned a lot. Firstly, I learned on the difficulty in designing. How much difficult
                is to think about colors that will paint your website. Secondly, I learned how to add music or video to my website.
                In conclusion, this website was a great process of learning and I'm really happy that I have been done it.<br /><br />
