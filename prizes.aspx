                        Each year, the winning team is presented with the European Champion Clubs' Cup,
                        the current version of which has been awarded since 1967. Any team that wins the Champions
                        League three years in a row or five times overall wins the right to retain a full-sized replica
                        of the trophy (UEFA retains the original at all times). Five clubs have earned this honour: Real Madrid,
                        Ajax, Bayern Munich, Milan and Liverpool. Since then instead the club which wins three years in a row or five overall
                        receives a conmemorative badge to wear permanently on their uniform.
                        <br /><br />
                        The current trophy is 74 cm tall and made of silver, weighing 11 kg.
                        It was designed by Jörg Stadelmann, a jeweller from Bern, Switzerland, after the original was given
                        to Real Madrid in 1966 in recognition of their six titles to date, and cost 10,000 Swiss francs.
                        As of the 2012–13 season, 40 gold medals are presented to the Champions League winners, and 40 silver medals to the runners-up.
